My CS340 Granzioso Salvare Database was created on 12/14/2024. I refined the original project by fixing middleware callback and file-naming errors, modularizing CRUD operations into a separate Python file, and improving documentation for easier setup and maintenance. This project demonstrates skills in client-server development, MongoDB database management, full-stack web development with Dash and Plotly, and secure access setup. Through these improvements, I achieved SNHU CS499 outcomes in software engineering, database management, security principles, data manipulation, and professional communication. The final artifact reflects my ability to build scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly applications.
