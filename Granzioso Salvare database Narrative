For the Granzioso Salvare database I went into the code and I cleaned it up so that when the website loads it does so at a faster speed and I went through and cleared the warnings that popped up with the code. I then went through and corrected the Readme that is attached to the zip which goes through and explains the software presented, how it works, and how to recreate it. This database artifact showcases my skills in software engineering through its modular design and CRUD logic. The database middleware communication shows my skills in client server development, database management and it showcases my ability to keep even simplified coding projects with a secure mindset as I still had set up a login control for the database. 
In terms of this courses outcomes, I feel I hit all of them, the software engineering and database management is done through my utilization of MongoDB and CRUD. Algorithms and Data structs come into play as I have the different levels that work together withthe use of dictionaries, JSON, and Pandas Dataframe. Client/Server Development is seen with my coding of MongoDB communicating with the client via a web dashboard. The outcome of security principles is seen through requiring credentials for access. My code utilizes modular design and the code is organized making it easier to colllaborate with future teams if I wanted to revisit this further and the readme has been completely revamped in order to showcase professional communication meaning another developer will have an easier time recreating it.
