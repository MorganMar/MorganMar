For my Security Policy Presentation Artifact, it was created on 08/24/2024. I made significant improvements to the clarity, consistency, and professional tone of the presentation, ensuring more precise descriptions of security concepts and correcting minor grammatical and typographical errors.I demonstrated the ability to apply security principles critical to modern software development. I showcased a strong understanding of Defense in Depth, secure coding standards, encryption policies, and DevSecOps practices. Throughout the presentation, I emphasized the importance of integrating security throughout the entire development lifecycle, from validating input data to automating code analysis with industry-standard tools such as Clang, Parasoft, and CppCheck. I also identified risks and benefits associated with responding to cybersecurity threats and recommended actionable strategies, including collaborative policy reviews and regular white-hat audits, to strengthen organizational security. As part of refining this artifact, This project highlights my ability to employ cybersecurity best practices, communicate complex technical concepts effectively to stakeholders, and advocate for collaborative solutionsâ€”skills that directly support the SNHU CS499 outcomes of software engineering, security principles, professional communication, and teamwork.
